# Democracy Atlas üåç

#### How does planet earth govern itself?

Billions of people are regularly encouraged, invited, or otherwise given a chance to have a one-person vote,
and ostensibly, a say in who rules them. Billions still get no say at all.

For many, it's a chore. For others, it's a right they would sacrifice their life for. 

In some places, where a person puts ink on a piece of paper changes the course of history. 
In others, a person's vote is a theatrical tool to lend legitimacy to people who tyrannize them.

### üåç Vision
With the **Democracy Atlas**, I'm building a comprehensive interactive atlas of the state of democracy around the world,
with a point of departure in political and electoral geography, and election results.

However, to tell a story, the Atlas will provide *context*. Quality of democracy (or lack thereof). Historical patterns.
Economic trends, demographic trends, and individual events. With the aim to provide an exploratory tool to understand
how humans participate in power.

### üöÄ Current Focus: Norway 2025
Launch Target: September 9, 2025 (Election Day)
Built under contract for a Norwegian news organization, the Norway edition demonstrates the platform's capabilities:

* Time-travel through elections from 1945 to live 2025 results
* Geographic exploration from national trends to individual municipalities
* Live election night with real-time vote counting and exit polls
* Contextual data linking voting patterns to demographics and economics

### üõ† Technical Architecture
**Backend:** Python (FastAPI) + PostgreSQL
**Frontend:** React + D3.js + TailwindCSS
**Data Pipelines:**  ETLs serving data from official sources
**Mapping:** GeoJSON/TopoJSON with custom cartographic optimizations
**Infrastructure:** Docker + Kubernetes on cloud hosting
**Built for scale:** Modular architecture designed to expand to global constituencies.

### üó∫ The Bigger Picture
Norway provides a proof of concept. The global atlas will integrate:

* Electoral data from every democracy
* Electoral data from non-democracies
* Historical context
* Demographic context
* Economic context
* Democracy indices (Economist, Freedom House, V-Dem)
* Contextual intelligence distinguishing meaningful elections from performance
* Historical depth showing how democracy evolves or devolves

**Target users:** Students, researchers, journalists, anyone curious about how the world governs itself and would enjoy it.

### üìÖ Roadmap

* **Q3 2025:** Norway launch + technical validation
* **Q4 2025:** Architecture for global expansion
* **Q4 2025:** United States
* **2026:** Core democratic countries
* **Beyond:** Global coverage with contextual democracy analysis

### üéØ Why This Matters
Current election visualization tools are fragmented, unavailable, outdated, or focus only on single countries. 
Democracy Atlas provides a one-stop shop to understand democratic participation globally.
